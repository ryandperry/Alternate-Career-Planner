# Hello+

This program runs using React Native on mobile devices and the web. It presents a scaled image of the UTK logo with rounded corners. Below it, there is a button that provides an alert when tapped. We will likely be using React Native in our project to create mobile apps and potentially a website.


## Running

After installing any prerequisites for React Native and Expo, I was able to run this program by using the following command in the project directory:

```bash
  npx expo start
```

This command will provide a link to a local webpage that can be used to view the project.
