# Sprint 1 Retrospective
## What you planned to do
* We did not use GitHub issues, but we made a shared Google Drive. We split our issues up a little bit so for the first week, I designed some screen options for comparing the current major hours with a dropdown of other hours, and then the second week I created this screen. My second week I also had to do data entry for CBE, BSE, and MSE. I also needed to plan/research a little for our group to decide if we were going to have to use javascript or if there was a way to combine C++ and javascript with react. 

## What you did not do

* I did not finish the data entry for MSE. 

## What problems you encountered
* I encountered time issues, as I had three exams and a 360 lab due this past week. I have also never coded in javascript until now so there was a large learning curve that I tried to get over. 
## Files you worked on
* alternate-career-planner/src/views/views-beatrice
* planning/Design Prototypes/MajorDetailView Designs/InterestPlanning.png
* planning/Design Prototypes/MajorDetailView Designs/InterestPlan2.png
* And I did the CBE and BSE entries in this google sheet that we are converting to a CSV: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1396Llo6YEQW1FxGvkfRYii44ywH6aEHaIX0b-_4ZzOM/edit?usp=sharing

## What you accomplished

* I developed a screen that displays the results from an interest quiz. The result from the interest quiz will pop up on a button, and if you want to (eventually) see how many more hours that major will be you can click on that button to see. Otherwise, if you are not interested in that major at all you can select another major from a drop-down menu, and then that will (eventually) lead you do another part that compares against a different major. To clarify, I did not actually link it to other pages or do any of our algorithm because we did not have any of the data entries inputted yet, but the screen is designed and can be implemented when ready. 

* I learned that we will just have to use javascript for the actual website, but for populating our sheet with all the links of the lookup table, we can use python since we're just creating the database and since we only have to do that one time. 

* I also plugged in ~100 different Course IDs, Course Titles, Course Hours, and Course Descriptions for Chemical Engineering and Biosystems Engineering majors. This took the majority of my time.
