### What you planned to do
- design a "database" set up to save data
- implement the "database" as a shared google excel sheet
- think of how we would use the database in our algorithm
- input 2 majors into the database: civil and environmental

### What you did not do
I did not input environmental because it doesnt exist on the 2023-2024 catalog.

### What problems you encountered
We didn't expect the catalog to be empty for 2022 and the DARS to be broken for 2024. So we're using the 2023 catalog year which isnt applicable to anyone in our class.

### Issues you worked on
I did not make any github issues. We created a shared google doc with issues. This is my section:
* Database layout plan and document 
* Make shared google sheet for group to input csv information
* 2 majors into csv - civil and environmental 


### Files you worked on
* planning/340_database_design.pdf
* planning/algorithm_notes.md
* data_collection/data_entry_instructions.md
* data_collection/database_design.xlsx


### What you accomplished
I designed a "database" set up to save all engineering majors, courses, prereqs, and descriptions as tables. It works together as a collection of ID-matched tables. As part of the design of the database, I also had to think of how we would use the database with our future algorithm to match student course history with the database information. I included some of those algorithm restrictions in the algorithm notes markdown file. I implemented the "database" as a shared google excel sheet with multiple tables for group members to input information. I created instructions for how people should input this. Then, I inputted civil engineering into the database and not environmental because it doesnt exist in the 2023 catalog. The skeleton version of this excel is in github history and the filled in one is availible now.
