# Sprint 2 
**Name**: Kale Dodson **GitID**: KaleDod **Group Name**: Alternate Career Planner


## What you planned to do

- Finish NE and BME csvs
- Fix continuity prolems with other csvs
- Create a table view for course history

## What you did not do

All of the tasks that I was planning on completing this sprint I was able to complete. In the next sprint with more of the data base being filled I will start to work on the algorithm that matches majors. 

## What Problems you encountered

The biggest problem that I encountered was figuring out how to make structues in React. Being able to create these structures and then pass them through multiple files and webpages. Another issue that I ran into was finding the course catalogs online, this is part of the issue that we are trying to solve. This was an issue for me because all of the majors need to use the same cataloge year so they are compatible.

## Files you worked on

Added CourseHistoryView
- CourseHistory.css
- CourseHistory.js
- CourseHistory.stories.js

Added csvs to the database
- major_5.csv
- major_10.csv
- major_9.csv
- major_4.csv

## What you accomplished

The biggest thing I was able to accomplish during this sprint was making the web page showing off the users course history. This is something that we will do with the data that the user inputs from the html file. Having this screen will also allow us to easily error check the parsing code that will be implemented in the next sprint. 

Having useable data in the database is also very important. Going through and making sure the data is normalized to the standards that we set as a group is crucial. Having this data also gives us data to be used in testing while we are creating the algorithm that compares majors.
