# Sprint 2
**Name**: Beatrice Eldridge
**Github ID**: bea-eldridge
**Group Name**: Alternate Career Planner

## What you planned to do
- Do all of MSE data entry and finish up prereq/coreq & bucket tables for MSE, BSE and CBE 
- Start on code to make my buttons go to another page
- Start on code that will populate the csv files so that all of the tables will be filled in

## What I did not do
- I did not get the button to work although I wrote code for it to do so 

## What problems I encountered
- Confusion about if my button would work in the storybook versus the npm run start 
- Assumption that I would be able to get the button to work without problems when that was not the case 
- A little bit of a misunderstanding of what the python code was meant to do and the misunderstanding that we cannot use python for backend stuf in react

## What I accomplished

I am really proud that I was able to accomplish all my data entry. It is a very tedious process and took way longer than I had expected last sprint so I made sure to dedicate a lot of time towards that in this sprint. It is also just extremely important to have all of that data inputted before we can really start using our algorithm so I know this will be a big help for our next sprint. 

I was also able to work with Emily to create some python code to make dictionaries of objects of Majors, Courses, and Buckets. Although we did realize at the end that we can't fully use it, I think I know a workaround. I was thinking of it as a population tool anyway, so once we populate all the majors then we will be done using python so I really don't think it is as big of a deal. 

I did work towards a functioning button and I have a plan to make it actually work too, so I know that although it is not complete it is definitely really close just based on analyzing my code versus the other buttons that exist.
