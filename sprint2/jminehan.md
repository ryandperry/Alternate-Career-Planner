# Sprint 2
**Name**: Jack Minehan
**Github ID**: jckmnhn
**Group Name**: Alternate Career Planner

## What you planned to do
- Make a list of potential jobs with sample jobs in MajorDetailView.
	- Issue #10
	- https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Alternate-Career-Planner/issues/10
- Create a navigation menu UI (We are waiting until next sprint to implement the links into App.js when everything can be tied together)
	- Issue #9
	- https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Alternate-Career-Planner/issues/9
- Create a header to be displayed across most pages using UT colors. I also ended up designing a logo for a site to be displayed on this.
	- Issue #8, Issue #12
	- https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Alternate-Career-Planner/issues/8
	- https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Alternate-Career-Planner/issues/12
## What you did not do
All planned items were completed. In the next sprint when all pages are written, I can begin tying links together with functional navigation.

## What problems you encountered
After beginning to design the header, I realized we had no logo or icon to be displayed next to the text. Therefore, I ended up taking on the fourth issue of designing a logo for the website.

## What you accomplished
In this sprint, I created a header, designed the website's logo, created the UI for a vertical navigation bar, and I created a UI with some sample jobs for common jobs of each major. Each item committed also includes sample storybook code for testing as well as well-designed CSS styling. Additionally, I ensured each component works on mobile and added some extra CSS styling to do so.

The header uses UT colors and displays the website name and logo. As a part of this process, I also created the logo in Pixelmator Pro and added favicons of various sizes for the webpage. The logo is a blend of a graduation cap and a planner to convey the website's purpose. The header is written in a way that it will work well with any other page and not overlap content.

The vertical navigation bar has titles and subheaders. We are planning on implementing navigation links in the next sprint, since not all pages are finished yet that would need to be linked to. Until then, I made this nice design and UI in which hovering over a subheader will create a sense of clickability by changing the mouse pointer and adding a dark background on a rounded rectangle around the subheader. The vertical navigation bar also functions well alongside the header and any other content without overlapping. An example of these components at play are in the MajorDetailView storybook.

I also added a new list at the bottom of MajorDetailView that lists some common jobs for each major. I originally copied and pasted some common job listings with the corresponding source in code comments, but I changed these to be more general rather than explicit copies of job listings. This uses UT colors and works well alongside the page's other content.
