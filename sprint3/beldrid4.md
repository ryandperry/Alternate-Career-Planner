# Sprint 1 Retrospective
**Name** Beatrice Eldridge
**GitHub ID** bea-eldridge
**Group Name** Alternate Career Planner 
## What you planned to do
- Enter all the technical electives into the database 
- It is somewhat of a wild goose chase to find them all, which is why this wasn't completed earlier 
    - Issue 35:
    - https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Alternate-Career-Planner/issues/35

- Â Work on processing the Person's data 
    - Issue 34:
    https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Alternate-Career-Planner/issues/34
- Work on the algorithm processing code with Emily 
    - Issue 33: 
    https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Alternate-Career-Planner/issues/33


## What you did not do

* All issues have been completed.

## What problems you encountered
* I encountered timing issues again, as I had a group project due for another class, a lab and an exam this sprint. I also found it difficult to see if my code was actually working without the JSON string to test it all. 
## Files you worked on
* population_be.py
* population.py
* data xlxs : https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1E1alq4b1VVZVT-bM-wm4Ntk35l7zIU-I/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=115797938718408015202&rtpof=true&sd=true

## What you accomplished

* I was able to work on the processing code and have a way for the course names of the person to be added to a set that will contain their course id so that we will not have to use the dictionary's values while we're trying to match. Searching on a value instead of a key is costly, so this will make that part be a lot more efficient, and probably easier for future me to read.

* I also worked on the psuedo code and partially coded the actual comparing course history algorithm. I coded how to compare all of their courses and then I also tried to include the buckets and nested buckets code for how to count those classes towards a different major.

* I also accomplished cleaning up the database; the reason it wasn't cleaned earlier is because as we are coding up the algorithm, we are noticing edge cases and realizing that we likely need to fix other parts of the database to make our coding job easier. As for the technical electives, I just didn't know where to find them earlier, so I was able to accomplish that with communication with Emily.
