## What you planned to do
- Algorithm Planning
- Complete CE database entry
  - Issue #39
- Write functions to print classes, buckets, and majors
  - Issue #40

## What you did not do
I was able to complete all of the tasks I planned on completing

## What problems you encountered
One of the biggest problems I ran into was not knowing python. I ran into a lot of issues of knowing what problem I had but not knowing what tools python has to solve them. This made it harder to write what are fairly simple functions over all. Another smaller problem was finding time to be able to meet with team members outside of class. But we were able to find times and worked on planning the algoritm that we are working on this sprint and last sprint.

## Issues you worked on
- Issue #39
- Issue #40

## Files you worked on
- population_kd.py

Data Entry
- major_4.csv
- course_table.csv
- bucket_table.csv

## What you accomplished
I was able to work with my group and make decisions on what type of  algorithm we wanted to write, what language we wanted to write in, as well as how we will connect the backend algorithm with the front end display. This was necessary to be able to continue working on the algorithm after sprint 2.

I was also able to finish the last major that was needed for the database. Now that all of the majors have been completed we are able to have complete data to test the algorithm with. This will allow us to find the bugs that we were not considering with the test data we have been using. 

Being able to complete the three functions for the algorithm was an important issue. Now we are able to print those to a JSON file that will be read in by the front end of the application. This allows us to be one step closer to having both ends of the app work together. Working on these functions has also allowed me to learn more about python that I did not know before. This is something that can help me outside of school later in my career.
