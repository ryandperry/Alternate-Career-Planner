# MajorDetailView Design Prototypes

This view will present a detailed description and overview of a course. To prepare for implementing this view, I designed some mockup UI prototypes in Figma. Personally, my favorite proposed design is `ImagePrototype`. The other included designs were developed during this process. 

The `ImagePrototype` view would require a banner image for each major, but these could easily be found on UTK's website under their major's descriptions. Sometimes, a large amount of text on a page can be overwhelming, but adding an image or color (such as the capsule shape around the # of required course hours) can help balance any sense of being overwhelmed.
