###Algorithm Notes

* We don’t accept transfer credit
* Grade < C doesn’t count
* W’s don’t count
* algorithm matches on ID
* If math 141 and math 147 have the same ID, the algorithm should match on IDs and that should count
* check prereqs and coreqs
* check for buckets
* C- only counts for 1 class in a major
* we don't check for ACT or SAT scores as prereq requirements
