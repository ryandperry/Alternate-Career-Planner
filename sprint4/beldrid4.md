# Sprint 1 Retrospective
**Name** Beatrice Eldridge
**GitHub ID** bea-eldridge
**Group Name** Alternate Career Planner 
## What you planned to do
- Work on the algorithm code 
- Help with flask 


## What you did not do

* All issues have been completed.

## What problems you encountered
* It is still difficult to see if it works because they are still not connected. Jack and I went to this person who said he would help us connect, and he actually didn't really, so then we were kind of just stuck until today. Luckily we have a lot of extra time that we did plan for so we're just going to keep working and tweaking. 
## Files you worked on
* population_sp4_be.py
* population.py
* flask.py

## What you accomplished

* I coded how to compare all of their courses and then I was able to include the buckets and nested buckets code for how to count those classes towards a different major.

* I also figured out what I should probably be returning to the server.
