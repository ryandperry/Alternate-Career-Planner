# Sprint 4
**Name**: Kale Dodson
**Github ID**: KaleDod
**Group Name**: Alternate Career Planner

## What you planned to do
- Algorithm Planning
- Update functions that Print Courses, Buckets, and Majors
  - Issue #48
- Exceptions for main comparison function
  - Issue #47
- Figure out Flask Server

## What you did not do
I was unable to complete the Exceptions for main comparison function. This required that I had a better understanding of new code that was written this sprint. I was not able to meet with the team member who wrote the code to find where my input was needed. This will be quickly fixed once we are able to have a meeting about the new code. 


## What problems you encountered
The biggest issue I encountered this week was trying to learn how to create a Flask server with the rest of the group. This is a new technology to all members making it even harder to be able to learn. Luckily we were able to get help from a TA of a different class we are in that had some experience with the tech.

## Issues you worked on
- Issue #48
- Issue #47

## Files you worked on
- population_kd.py
- population.py


## What you accomplished
I was able to work with my group to help setup the Flask server that we will be using to connect the backend algorith with the front end website. 

I was also able to rework the print functions that I made last week. I updated these to be more interconnected allowing for just 1 function call to make them easier to use.
