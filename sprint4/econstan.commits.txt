It works together as a collection of ID-matched tables. As part of the design of the database, I also had to think of how we would use the database with our future algorithm to match student course history with the database information. I included some of those algorithm restrictions in the algorithm notes markdown file. I implemented the "database" as a shared google excel sheet with multiple tables for group members to input information. I created instructions for how people should input this. Then, I inputted civil engineering into the database and not environmental because it doesnt exist in the 2023 catalog. The skeleton version of this excel is in github history and the filled in one is availible now.

My part of the code was the bottom-most for loop that goes through each csv that hold major requirements and fills in the specific courses and bucket requirements lists in the major object. I got set up with python, pandas, and storybook. I cleaned up our "database" and added all the requirements for the industrial engineering major. i also went through the data and found places where we need to clean up before reading it in to our comparison algorithm. I realized my limitations on react and im prepared to learn more about that from kale on the next sprint.

So I focused more time on the data processing code. Also, part of finalizing the database meant cleaning up past work that wasn't correct and marking down instances where logic needed to be hardcoded. Which we still have more work to do on.

econstan.md  (emily constantin on 10/31/2024 at 21:18): I successfully added code to add the prereqs and coreqs for each course. I did some code cleanup from last sprint because i didn't realize there were some bugs. I went through our "database" aka big excel sheet and marked everything that wasnt finished yet. As part of the cleanup task, I fixed some errors in the connections between bucket, course, and major requirements tables. i also added code to process nested buckets properly and decided which major requirements (like tech electives) will have to be hardcoded (to do next sprint).
