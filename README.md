### Project Description

Students in Tickle College of Engineering often get into their major and
realize that they love engineering, but want a different specialty. This
alternate career planner project will allow students to upload their 
DARS report webpage (in HTML) and see all other engineering majors ranked
from the least number of courses left.

Using Expo Go, we will build a webapp that accepts HTML files, processes
their academic history, compares it to the requirements for all other 
engineering majors and displays the bachelor degrees that require the least
number of classes to graduate.
