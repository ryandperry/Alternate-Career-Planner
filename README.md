# Alternate Career Planner

## Project Description

Students in Tickle College of Engineering often get into their major and realize that they love engineering, but want a different specialty. Alternate Career Planner allows students to upload their DARS report webpage (in HTML) and view all other engineering majors ranked from the least number of remaining course requirements.
