1,CS,Computer Science,"Computer Science is the systematic study of algorithmic processes that describe and transform information: their theory, analysis, design, efficiency, implementation, and application. The fundamental question underlying all of computing is: What can efficiently be automated? Computer Science is far more than programming. It incorporates the paradigms of theory (mathematical), abstraction (experimental), and design (engineering) within many topic areas"
2,CE,Computer Engineering,
3,EE,Electrical Engineering,
4,AE,Aerospace Engineering,"Aerospace engineering uses the basic sciences and mathematics to develop the foundation for the design, development, production, testing, and applied research associated with aerospace vehicles. These vehicles include aircraft, spacecraft, and missiles."
5,BME,Biomedical Engineering,The biomedical engineering curriculum integrates selected engineering sciences and design methods with life science coursework. The program prepares students for careers in a variety of health care related professions including work for medical device manufacturers and regulatory governmental agencies. The course content of the biomedical engineering curriculum complements the departmental strengths in mechanical engineering and includes a comprehensive coverage of engineering materials and biomechanics applications
6,BSE,Biosystems Engineering,
7,CBE,Chemical Engineering,"Chemical Engineers utilize chemistry, physics, and math to develop and design chemical manufacturing processes."
8,IE,Industrial Engineering,
9,ME,Mechanical Engineering,"Mechanical engineering involves the design, analysis, testing, and manufacture of mechanical and thermal systems. Mechanical engineers are employed in nearly every industry, from basic research through mass production of energy systems, computer software/hardware, robotics, and vehicles of all kinds."
