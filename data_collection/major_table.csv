1,CS,121,100,Computer Science,"Computer Science is the systematic study of algorithmic processes that describe and transform information: their theory, analysis, design, efficiency, implementation, and application. The fundamental question underlying all of computing is: What can efficiently be automated? Computer Science is far more than programming. It incorporates the paradigms of theory (mathematical), abstraction (experimental), and design (engineering) within many topic areas",,
2,CE,126,105,Computer Engineering,"Computer engineering deals with the design, construction, and implementation of the hardware and software components that comprise computers, computer-controlled systems, and networks of computing devices. Modern computing appears everywhere in our daily lives, including the development and maintenance of systems such as many-core computer processors, internet-of-things (IoT) systems, and cyberphysical control systems, to name a few. Example applications include smart phones, autonomous vehicles, robotics, automotive embedded systems, voice-controllable systems, image processing, and supercomputer architectures.",,
3,EE,125,104,Electrical Engineering,"Electrical engineering deals with the application of the physical laws governing charged particles. From miniature integrated circuits that contain millions of microelectronic devices, to high-speed fiber-optic communication systems that span international boundaries, electrical engineering impacts every aspect of modern-day living.

Electrical engineering is unique among the engineering disciplines because of its wide range of applications. Subject areas are so diverse, it is not always apparent that there is an underlying connection. The range of subjects is not only broad but also expanding.",,
4,AE,131,110,Aerospace Engineering,"Aerospace engineering uses the basic sciences and mathematics to develop the foundation for the design, development, production, testing, and applied research associated with aerospace vehicles. These vehicles include aircraft, spacecraft, and missiles.",,
5,BME,131,110,Biomedical Engineering,The biomedical engineering curriculum integrates selected engineering sciences and design methods with life science coursework. The program prepares students for careers in a variety of health care related professions including work for medical device manufacturers and regulatory governmental agencies. The course content of the biomedical engineering curriculum complements the departmental strengths in mechanical engineering and includes a comprehensive coverage of engineering materials and biomechanics applications,,
6,BSE,126,105,Biosystems Engineering,"Our faculty includes biosystems engineers, soil scientists, and a bio-climatologist, together with a gifted technical support staff. Our programs encompass the full range of the land-grant mission, which includes teaching, outreach and service. Our research projects can be, but are not limited to, sensors and soil testing, spray technology and water quality, precision agriculture and environmental modeling, soil physics and vegetable production systems, agricultural safety and chemical transport, food quality and machinery systems, waste treatment and environmental rehabilitation, electrical systems and subsurface hydrology. Please explore the site to learn more.",,
7,CBE,127,106,Chemical Engineering,"Chemical Engineers utilize chemistry, physics, and math to develop and design chemical manufacturing processes.",,
8,IE,128,107,Industrial Engineering,"A new way of thinking is required to address the significant challenges facing twenty-first century cities. Today’s urban centers need clean air and water, efficient transportation, reliable infrastructure, and sustainable energy sources to thrive. That’s why we focus our educational and research priorities on the development of new construction materials and processes, advanced sensor technologies, and data science techniques. Our students are poised to become tomorrow’s leaders in resilient urban ecology and innovators in safer, smarter, and sustainable infrastructure.",,
9,ME,130,109,Mechanical Engineering,"Mechanical engineering involves the design, analysis, testing, and manufacture of mechanical and thermal systems. Mechanical engineers are employed in nearly every industry, from basic research through mass production of energy systems, computer software/hardware, robotics, and vehicles of all kinds.",,
10,NE,124,103,Nuclear Engineering,"Established in 1957, UT’s Department of Nuclear Engineering was the first and continues to be one of the most prestigious in the United States. Our faculty is internationally recognized for excellence in research and
 teaching, and our advanced research programs are enhanced by close ties
 with Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the Y-12 Nuclear Security Complex, UCOR, at the East Tennessee Technology Park (ETTP), and more than one hundred nuclear related companies located within fifty miles of Knoxville. East Tennessee may have the largest concentration of nuclear industry 
anywhere in the world and is therefore an ideal place to come for 
nuclear education. ",,
11,CVE,126,105,Civil Engineering,"The goal of the Civil Engineering undergraduate degree program is to prepare graduates who can perform at the entry level in civil engineering practice having responsibility for the planning, design, implementation, operation, and maintenance of civil engineering infrastructure. It is expected that some years after graduation, they can become licensed professionals. Graduates will be provided with skills and tools for life-long learning, continuing professional development, and pursuing advanced degrees.",,
12,MSE,125,104,Material Science & Engineering,"At the Department of Materials Science Engineering, we stay on the leading edge of technology through the development of new materials and the improvement of existing materials for applications in all engineering fields. As an interdisciplinary field, MSE is at the forefront of modern technological advances, offering students a stepping stone to solving tomorrow’s grand challenges as they take their next steps toward their future in engineering.",,
