This course combines traditional lectures and class dialogue. Students will learn the fundamentals of radiation, nuclear chemistry, and physics that are needed to understand concepts of nuclear reactions, including fission and fusion. Introduces the concepts of nuclear reactor theory and analysis needed to understand nuclear power engineering. Class discussions on the technical and policy aspects associated with nuclear (non) proliferation and the nuclear fuel cycle, most specifically involving the management of spent nuclear fuel. Introduces the application of nuclear radiation with matter in terms of understanding concepts of radiation protection, radiation detection, and health physics."
